I went on a quick roadtrip around NZ. I thought that writing a little quiz would be a fun way to have friends and family, see how my adventure went. This will also be a good reminder for me :)

I intend to have a number of quiz topics (music, sights, pictures etc.,) and a speed round, taking 10 randomly assigned questions and give the user a set amount of time to answer the questions.
